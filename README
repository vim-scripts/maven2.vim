This is a simple compiler plugin to use quickfix with maven2. It sets
makeprg to "mvn", and sets the errorformat appropriately. Activate
with "compiler maven2".

Since this expects the pom.xml to be in the current working directory,
try adding something like the following to your .vimrc:

augroup my-project-X
  au!
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead    */project/x/*       lcd <directory-containing-pom>
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead    */project/x/*       compiler maven2
augroup END

Known problems: the compiler output uses a 0-based column number, but vim
expects a 1-based column, so the cursor is off by one.
